# Deep Neural Network
Python implementation of deep neural network  from scratch with a mathmatical approach.

## Table of contents:
1. Overview
2. Intializing paramaters
3. Forward propagation
4. Backward propagation
5. predict

## 1.Forward propagation :
Forward propagation is mainly broken into two steps:
1. linear forward:
    calculating z = w.x + b
    
2. activation:
    pluging z into the activation function sigmoid or relu ...
    A = g(z)
